font-awesome-rails-sass
=======================

Working copy of font-awesome for Rails using Sass

There are no existing gems with current working font-awesome with sass.

The official gem, font-awesome-rails does not correctly generate the path to
digest asset files in production while using Sass.

The font-awesome-sass gem has had a commit pending for upgrading to the Rails 4 asset
pipeline for several months.
